# Skills

A **skill** is a reusable instruction bundle you assign to a profile.

Think of it as a saved workflow:

- The profile keeps its main identity in soul files or `systemPrompt`
- A skill adds a focused procedure for a specific kind of task
- The agent can match and use that procedure when it is relevant

Use skills when you want the bot to follow the same steps repeatedly without cramming everything into the main prompt.

## Why skills matter

Skills help keep profiles clean.

For example:

- A support bot can have one skill for bug triage
- A content bot can have one skill for rewriting release notes
- An ops bot can have one skill for incident summaries

This gives you smaller, clearer building blocks instead of one giant prompt.

## How skills fit with profiles

Skills are assigned per profile, just like tools and MCP servers.

| Layer | What it controls |
|------|-------------------|
| Soul / `systemPrompt` | The bot's overall identity and rules |
| Skills | Repeatable workflows or task-specific instructions |
| Tools | Actions the bot is allowed to take |
| MCP servers | Extra external tools |

A profile can have many skills, and the same global skill can be assigned to more than one profile.

## Two kinds of skills

### Global skills

Global skills live in the shared skill library:

```text
~/.tinyclaw/agent/skills/
```

These are useful when the same workflow should be reusable across multiple profiles.

### Profile-scoped skills

Profile-scoped skills live inside one org/profile workspace:

```text
~/.tinyclaw/orgs/{orgId}/profiles/{profileId}/skills/
```

These are useful when the workflow only makes sense for one specific bot.

## Skill file format

Each skill is stored in its own directory with a `SKILL.md` file.

Minimal example:

```md
---
name: weather
description: Use when the user asks for a weather forecast.
---

# Skill instructions

1. Ask for the city if missing.
2. Check the forecast.
3. Summarize it clearly.
```

Required frontmatter:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| `name` | Yes | Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only |
| `description` | Yes | Short summary of when the skill should be used |

Optional frontmatter:

| Field | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `disable-model-invocation` | Only run on explicit invocation |
| `include-body-on-match` | Include the full body when the skill auto-matches |

## Skills with tools

A skill can also include a local tool module in the same directory:

- `tool.ts`
- `tool.js`

When present, the dashboard shows the skill as **includes tool**.

This is useful when the workflow needs both:

- Instructions in `SKILL.md`
- A small custom tool that the skill can use

## How skills are used at runtime

When a profile starts a chat, TinyClaw appends the assigned skills catalog to the agent prompt.

On each user turn, TinyClaw can also attach matched skill context for the current message.

That means skills are not a separate bot. They are extra behavior layers attached to a profile.

TinyClaw also ships bundled skills for system workflows. The `create-profile` bundled skill is assigned only to Super Bot, so profile-authoring instructions load when Super Bot is asked to create a profile without adding those instructions to ordinary profile prompts.

For more detail, see [Agent prompts](/agent-prompt).

## How to create and assign skills

There are two common paths.

### From the dashboard

Platform admins can:

1. Go to **Agent → Profiles**
2. Open a profile
3. Use the **Skills** section to add, assign, unassign, or inspect skills

The dashboard also supports a shared skill library through the skills API and sync flow.

### From the agent itself

If a profile has the builtin `create_skill` tool, the bot can create a new profile-scoped skill during chat and assign it immediately.

New custom profiles receive `create_skill`, `knowledge_base_search`, and `update_profile_memory` by default when those builtins are available.

## Sync behavior

TinyClaw discovers skills from disk and syncs them into the database.

This is why there is a skills sync step:

- Files on disk are the source material
- The database stores discovered metadata for the dashboard and API

If you add or change skill folders manually, run skill sync so TinyClaw refreshes what it knows.

## Permissions

Skill management is a platform-admin operation in the dashboard and API.

| Actor | Can manage skills | Can use a profile with skills |
|------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Platform admin | Yes | Yes |
| Org admin | No | Yes |
| Org member | No | Yes |
| Org viewer | No | No |

Viewers cannot invoke agents, so they cannot trigger skills either.

## When to use a skill vs something else

- Use a **skill** for a repeatable workflow
- Use the **main profile prompt** for always-on behavior and identity
- Use a **builtin tool** for a native capability like web search or file access
- Use an **MCP server** for external tool integrations

- [Builtin tools](/builtin-tools) — the actions a profile can take
- [MCP servers](/mcp) — external tools assigned to a profile
